    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      “Ultra Worx Ltd. was born from a desire to be a working-at-height solutions group that puts safety above everything else. 
      Our founders—Evelake Halcyon, Tony Lam, and Michael Carver—noticed a troubling gap in the rope access industry. 
      Despite its importance, safety, inspection, and proper usage were often overlooked, leading to stalled risk assessments and unchecked unknowns. 
      Determined to change this, we built our company on the foundation of industry expertise, innovation, and an uncompromising commitment to safety. 
      Today, our proven track record on some of the largest construction sites in the country speaks to our relentless pursuit of excellence.”
